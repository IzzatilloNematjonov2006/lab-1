    <p>This project is currently being built, so only important content is present to have an image of a whole structure.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Some basic elements from the last lesson:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>'!DOCTYPE html' - starting point of an HTML file.</li>
        <li>'html' - root of an HTML page</li>
        <li>'head' - header part of the file. Contains meta data about the page</li>
        <li>'body' - body part of the file. Contains actual/visible data about the page</li>
        <li>'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4' - header element. Header goes up to/down to 'h6'. As the number beneath h increases, the size of the text decreases</ol>
        <li> 'a' - hyperlink. HTML links are hyperlinks. 'a' is used to link another page into the current page's element. For example, in my project, text "Lesson 0" has "a" element which leads to the another page.</li>
        <li>'img' - this tag is used embed an image to the page. However, in my project, since I haven't decided which picture to use, I intentionally used a wrong source path to output 'alt' element which is an alternative text that is displayed in case a picture fails to be displayed</li>

    </ul>
